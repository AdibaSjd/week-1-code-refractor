# creating semantic elements for a page

customer asked for a page with semantic eleets to allow the browser to understand the page better to make it more acciable to all users.

## User Story

- As a developer i want a page that is accessible to both browsers and developers
- So that are site contains meaning across various search engines


## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN page that is understable across search engines
- WHEN semantic HTML elements are set to be understood across search engines
- WHEN I can see section, heading, main, aside and footer attributes
- WHEN Images contain alt attriutes to have meaning 
- WHEN page forms in a set sequence
- WHEN navigation buttons worked accordingly to the page

My main issue was insuring my page fit into the catergory of a semantic layout of the page for the browser to read. Althrough understandable through vs code for a developer it was important that this was also understandable with search engines.

## General info
This is a page developed through html and later styled through CSS. The lay out of the page was used using semantic HTML elements changed from div elemets enabling description to both the browser and developers looking into it. This allowed for more throught into the stucture of the page and easier navigation providing meaning to the page.
